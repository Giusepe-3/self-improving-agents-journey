# Simplified ADAS Project Requirements
# 
# Core dependencies for running the Automated Design of Agentic Systems implementation

# Data handling and scientific computing
numpy>=1.20.0

# Visualization for experiment results
matplotlib>=3.5.0

# Optional: Enhanced plotting
seaborn>=0.11.0

# Note: This implementation uses only Python standard library features
# plus the above packages for numerical operations and visualization.
# 
# For a production ADAS system, you might also want:
# - transformers (for real LLM integration)
# - torch/tensorflow (for neural network components)  
# - wandb (for experiment tracking)
# - ray (for distributed agent search)
